Evaluation Notes

Purpose: Record test cases, edge cases, and notes for reviewers evaluating the submission.

Contents:
- Test inputs used: `test_inputs.txt` (example lines covering explicit deadlines, vague deadlines, missing fields, and multiple formats).
- Validation: `scripts/validate_outputs.py` enforces exact key sets, numeric quantity, ISO deadline format, and allowed urgency values.
- Recovery tests: Unit tests validate local repair behavior, LLM correction retry, and final null-filled fallback.
- Known limitations: Quantity parsing is intentionally minimal (numeric parsing only); richer normalization (packs, unit conversion) is future work.

Review guidance:
- Run tests with `pytest -q` and validate outputs with `python scripts/validate_outputs.py`.
- Use `AI_STRUCTURER_USE_MOCK=1` for offline testing; provide `GROQ_API_KEY` for live evaluation.

Conclusion: The pipeline enforces safety-first guarantees; outputs are conservative and auditable.
